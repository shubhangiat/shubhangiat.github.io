I am a researcher with experience in *Graph databases* and *Graph mining*.
I did my post-doctoral research with [Prof. Angela Bonifati](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/angela.bonifati/) at the LIRIS lab in University Lyon 1, France. We explored the possibility of a novel
hybrid data model that combines the properties of both _Property graphs_ and _Time series_, for a
time-enriched graph representation.

I got my PhD in 2023 from Department of Computer Science, IIT Kanpur, India, where I worked with
my supervisor and mentor [Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/arnabb/). 
My thesis focused on *Approximate Subgraph Querying* in both deterministic and probabilistic
settings, as well as explored node embeddings in graphs based on relative position of the nodes
in the graph.
